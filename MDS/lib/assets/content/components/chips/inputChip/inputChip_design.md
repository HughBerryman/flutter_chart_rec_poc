**Usage**

Per Flutter, Input chips represent a complex piece of information, such as an entity (person, place, or thing) or conversational text, in a compact form.

Note:

- FmiAvatar should use FmiAvatarSize.small.
- Trailing icon _not delete icon_ should be styled as icon small with left padding.
- Delete icon is part of theme.
- All other styling is included in theming. No customizations required.
