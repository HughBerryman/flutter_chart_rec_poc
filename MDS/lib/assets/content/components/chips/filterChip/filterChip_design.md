**Usage**

Per Flutter, Filter chips use tags or descriptive words as a way to filter content.

Note:

- FmiAvatar should use FmiAvatarSize.small.
- Trailing icon _not delete x icon_ should be styled as icon small with left padding.
- Delete icon is part of theme.
- Avatar parameter should be used for checkmark.
- All other styling is included in theming. No customizations required.
