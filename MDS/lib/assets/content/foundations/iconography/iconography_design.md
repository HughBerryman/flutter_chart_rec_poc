Icons can be used to represent common actions or packing an informative punch into a small form factor. To ensure consistency and readability, their limited size means that each icon must strictly adhere to guidance while still expressing essential characteristics. 

`  ` 

 
MDS has six sizes across two different styles; light and solid. Each has been sized appropriately to the design token sizes: 

* Xsmall 
* Small 
* Medium 
* Large 
* Xlarge 
* 48

All Font Awesome icons utilize the [Font Awesome Font Library](https://fontawesome.com/search) unless identified by the designer. Any new icons needed should be sourced from this icon set. In Figma, the name of the specific icon should be marked on the layer in the left panel. Please be in communication with your designer if any questions arise about the icons used.
