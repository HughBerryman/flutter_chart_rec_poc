Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible. Hierarchy is key to the overall structure of a design and is communicated through differences in font weight, size, line height and letter spacing. It helps to arrange text to highlight the importance of information and make it more readable.

MDS uses [SF Pro Text](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) within their design interfaces. The Apple font is designed to optimally display text at a variety of sizes and in a wide range of languages across multiple interfaces. MDS typography is organized in five key type styles that are named to describe their purposes: 

* Display 
* Headline 
* Title 
* Label 
* Body 

`  `  


The roles are device-agnostic, allowing easier application across a variety of use cases. Within each type style, there are three type scales:  

* Large 
* Medium 
* Small 

`  `  


The breakdown is visualized in the [Typography](https://www.figma.com/file/TN3spserGlpzL1SThq1uOW/Mineral-Design-System?type=design&node-id=59608-21443&mode=design) section of the MDS design system in Figma and identifies the size, line height and letter spacing for each style.

**Important Note:** A designer can change the font weight to a typography theme if desired. Unfortunately, Figma doesnâ€™t allow the plugin to truly set 2 typography tokens to a specific text. The designer will rename the text layer in the left panel to the desired typography theme and font weight (i.e., display/large, fontWeight=Bold). Be sure to discuss any questions with the designer to ensure the desired text style is added properly among the design.
