#### Logos  

Logos are a point of identification; a symbol that customers use to recognize a company’s brand. The [Freeport logos](https://www.figma.com/file/TN3spserGlpzL1SThq1uOW/Mineral-Design-System?type=design&node-id=59608-21503&mode=design) have been added within the Figma MDS design system in the following sizes: 

* Small 
* Medium 
* Large 

`  ` 

The designer can select the desired color version needed for their specific designs. Please note not all logos have a black or white version. The available options to select from were provided by the marketing team. 

`  `  

*Important Note:* Designers should reference the Freeport brand guidelines for proper usage in their client application. An SVG and PNG file can be exported directly from Figma. Please work with the designer to get any necessary files. 

`  `  

If logos are used within a design, they may need to be tokenized appropriately to the use case depending on the Fmi or OOB component it’s placed within and available parameters. Icon and image token sizes should be used in these cases. 

`  `
