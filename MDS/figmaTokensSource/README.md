# Figma Tokens Source

## ***DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT ANY FILES WITHIN THIS DIRECTORY***

This is the shared source of truth for design tokens used in Figma files to allow the same token file to be used across multiple files.

The only changes in this directory should be made from within the Figma Tokens plugin on the 'tokens' branch.

Periodically these changes will be merged into 'main'.
When this happens, do not delete the tokens branch, as it is still the location set up in the plugin for token updates.
